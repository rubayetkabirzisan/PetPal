// This file serves as the entry point for the application.
// It re-exports the default export from the expo-router/entry file.

import 'expo-router/entry';

// You can add additional setup or initialization code here if needed.
// For example, global error handlers, analytics initialization, etc.

// For most cases, this file can remain simple as expo-router handles the routing.
